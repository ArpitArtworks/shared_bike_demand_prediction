# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
> Model to predict the demand for shared bikes. 
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. 

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

- What is the dataset that is being used?
Count of Bike Sharing against differenet variables.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
1. Company should focus on expanding business when temperature is high.
2. Company should focus on expanding business during Winter.
3. Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to 2019.
4. There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes without having business impact.
